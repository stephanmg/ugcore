# Toolchain file for JuQueen (type IBM Blue Gene/Q) FZ Juelich.
#
# This toolchain file is included in a CMake run by (check with 'cmake --trace')
# 'Modules/CMakeDetermineSystem.cmake', and (later again) by the - generated -
# file '<ug4_build_dir>/CMakeFiles/CMakeSystem.cmake'.
# (Subdirectory 'Modules/' is part of your CMake installation, on JuQueens login
# nodes: '/usr/local/cmake/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/').
#
# Appropriate platform files for the "CMake system name" and compilers chosen
# here are called later (by 'Modules/CMakeSystemSpecificInformation.cmake'):
#
# I.e., for "BlueGeneQ-static" as "CMake system name" the platform file
# 'Modules/Platform/BlueGeneQ-static.cmake' is included first, which includes
# 'Modules/Platform/BlueGeneQ-base.cmake'. Afterwards CMake calls
# 'Modules/Platform/BlueGeneQ-static-GNU-C.cmake' and
# 'Modules/Platform/BlueGeneQ-static-GNU-CXX.cmake'
# if GNU compilers are chosen (by 'Modules/CMakeCInformation.cmake' and
# 'Modules/CMakeCXXInformation.cmake' respectively).

# Attention:
# For this to work a CMake version with platform files for Blue Gene/Q are required.
# The currently (October 2012) installed version on JuQueen does not (the FZJ
# support is asked to support one).
#
# In the meantime the Juqueen platform-files supplied with ug are used (located
# in cmake/modules/Platform). Those stem from
# 'http://www.cmake.org/Bug/bug_relationship_graph.php?bug_id=13512&graph=dependency'
