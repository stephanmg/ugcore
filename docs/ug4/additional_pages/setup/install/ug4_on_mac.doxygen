[TOC]

Before installing something on a Mac, make sure things aren't already installed by some other user by checking
the appropriate commands in the terminal (<tt>gcc --version</tt> and <tt>cmake --version</tt>).

MacOS Versions are:
- MacOS X 10.5 Leopard
- MacOS X 10.6 Snow Leopard
- MacOS X 10.7 Lion
- MacOS X 10.8 Mountain Lion
- MacOS X 10.9 Mavericks -> goto \ref secInstallMac109 .

You can obtain your version by clicking on the apple in the left upper corner -> "about this mac".
The \em terminal is located in <tt>Programs -> utilities (Dienstprogramme) -> Terminal</tt>.

\section secInstallUg Installation of UG4
Please follow the description at https://github.com/UG4/ughub/wiki to obtain a
copy of \ug4. Below you'll find hints on how to obtain additional software which
is required to build \ug4.


<hr>
\section secInstallMacCMake CMake
<hr>

<ul>
  <li>Download \em CMake:
    Download the <a href="http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.12-Darwin64-universal.dmg">
    CMake 2.8.12 dmg-file</a> (see also <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">here</a>. 
    (! minimum version 2.8.10 !)
  </li>
  <li>Install \em CMake on your computer.
    Install the command line tools, when requested during installation.
  </li>
  <li>Open a terminal window.
    Enter <tt>cmake</tt>.
    If you see some output <tt>cmake version ...</tt> \em CMake has been 
    installed correctly.
  </li>
</ul>


<hr>
\section secInstallMac109 GCC on MacOS X 10.9 Mavericks
<hr>
In order to use UG4 with MacOS X 10.9 Commandline Tools should be installed properly. This can be done be entering the following command into Terminal:
\verbatim
xcode-select --install
\endverbatim

\note There have been some problems with old cmake versions and mavericks, especially after upgrading your system. Make sure you have cmake 2.8.12.


<hr>
\section secInstallMacGCC GCC on MacOS X <= 10.8
<hr>

Easiest way is to use Kenneth Reitz' page on gcc/command line utilities: https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/ .

Another way is to use the Apple homepage:
<ul>
<li>Create a apple developer ID <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">here</a> (it's free).
<li>Go to https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action, search for "Command Line Tools", pick the appropriate version.
<li>Install. Now you should have gcc and svn (!) available in the terminal.
</ul> 
 
\note XCode, installed through the AppStore, will \em not provide you with command line utilities. 
\note you can install Macports and upgrade your compilers then.

<hr>
\section secInstallMacAdditional Additional Software
<hr>
Highly recommended:
- SVN : Subversion for the terminal (check in terminal if <tt>svn</tt> works, otherwise install). http://www.wandisco.com/subversion/download#osx
- OpenMPI : for parallel computing. (check if <tt>mpicc</tt> is available). 
Other:
- X11 : Window manager used by some programs, not included in MacOS 10.8. http://xquartz.macosforge.org/
- doxygen : to create this docu locally.
- gnuplot
- ParaView

You can install most of this with \ref pageUginstall.

If you need fortran/gfortran on Mountain Lion: http://web.mit.edu/mfloyd/www/computing/mac/gfortran/, <tt>sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gfortran-4.2 /usr/bin/gfortran</tt>.
