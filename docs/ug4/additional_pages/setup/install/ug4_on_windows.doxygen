\section secInstallUg Installation of UG4
Please follow the description at https://github.com/UG4/ughub/wiki to obtain a
copy of \ug4. Below you'll find hints on how to obtain additional software which
is required to build \ug4.


<hr>
\section secWindowsCompiler Compiler

The Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 compiler is recommended for compilation of \ug4
on windows. It can be downloaded as part of the free
"Express 2013 for Windows Desktop" edition of Visual Studio
(https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx).

To allow for parallel compilation in the terminal one can use the tool "jom"
(https://wiki.qt.io/Jom). Extract it and add the path in which the executable
lies to your path environment variable.

<hr>
\section secInstallWindowsCMake Install CMake on Windows

Compilation of \ug4 furthermore requires the installation of \em CMake, which 
can be obtained from here http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
(min Release 2.6).

If the option is presented to you by the installer, you should choose to install
the command-line tools, too.

<hr>
\section secWindowsBuild	Building

	-	Open 'VS2013 x64 Cross Tools-Eingabeaufforderung'
		(Start -> All Programs -> Visual Studio 2013 -> Visual Studio-Tools)
		if you want to compile a 64bit version of \ug4. If you only want to
		compile for 32bit, use 'VS2013 x86 Native Tools-Eingabeaufforderung'.
	
	-	Navigate to your ug4-source-code root folder

	- 	create a new directory called 'build' ('mkdir build').

	-	Before cmake can be run and before jom can be executed one hast to initialize
		Visual Studios environment variables.

	-	type 'cmake -G"NMake Makefiles JOM" ..\trunk -DSTATIC_BUILD=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDIM="2;3" -DCPU=1'.
		This generates the makefiles required by Jom. You only have to execute cmake if
		you're initializing a build directory for the first time or if you want to
		change build options. See note below if you want to use the Visual Studio IDE directly.

	-	You may enable or disable other plugins using cmake, e.g.: 'cmake ..\trunk -DSmallStrainMechanics=OFF'

	-	to execute a build, type 'jom'

\note	If you want to embed the build-process in your favorite IDE (e.g. Eclipse or Sublime)
		you most likely have to initialize the build environment before executing jom.
		You can do this by calling '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86_amd64'
		before calling jom.

\note	If you want to compile directly using the VisualStudio IDE, you should specify another
		builder for cmake. Create a new build directory and call 'cmake -G"Visual Studio 2013" ...'
		(rest as above). This creates a visual-studio project which you can edit and compile
		using the Visual Studio IDE.
