/** \page pageInstallEclipse Developing with the Eclipse IDE

[TOC]

The page is an install guide for the usage of Eclipse for ug.

\note If you're working at the G-CSC, there is a preconfigured Eclipse download available. Ask for "software server".

<hr>
\section secInstallEclipseDownload Download Eclipse

<ul>
  <li>Download the latest release of \em Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/neonm4a :
    <em>Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</em>
  </li>
  <li>Unzip \em Eclipse and move it to your "Application" folder (MAC only)</li>
  <li> Start \em Eclipse.
    On startup you are requested to choose a workspace.
    This is the location, where your projects will be placed.
    Specially, \ug4 will be placed here.
    So, choose an folder where you want \ug4 to be downloaded to.
    (e.g. <tt>home/projects/</tt>)
  </li>
  <li>Make sure that the Eclipse-git Plugin 'EGit' is installed.</li>
</ul>


<hr>
\section secUG4AndEclipse Generating Eclipse Project-Files
In order work with UG4 in Eclipse, please download and install UG4 as usual through
UG4's package-manager (see https://github.com/UG4/ughub/wiki).

You'll find detailed instructions on how to generate and import UG4 project-files
for Eclipse here: https://github.com/UG4/ughub/wiki#importing-ug4-into-your-ide


<hr>
\section secInstallEclipseUseMakefiles Build in Eclipse using external Makefiles
<hr>

In order to build the \ug4 libraries via \em Eclipse, you first must create the 
Makefiles.
This is done using \em Cmake in the terminal (go to \ref pageUG4Setup if you did not already install \em CMake).

<ol>
  <li>Open a terminal/shell window</li>
  <li>move into your workspace directory you chose before</li>
  <li><tt>cd ug4</tt></li>
  <li><tt>mkdir build_debug</tt></li>
  <li><tt>cd build_debug</tt></li>
  <li><tt>cmake -DDEBUG=ON ..</tt> --> Makefiles are generated</li>
</ol>

Note, that once the Makefiles have been created, you do not have to rebuild them
at any time.
This step has to be performed only once.
Now, these Makefiles can be used in \em Eclipse:

<ol>
  <li>Click right on folder <tt>ug4</tt> -> Choose \em Properties </li>
  <li>Under <em>C/C++-Build</em>:</li>
  <li>Disable <em>Generate Makefiles automatically</em></li>
  <li>Disable <em>Use default build command</em></li>
  <li>Choose <em>Build directory: ...</em> -> Click <em>Filesystem</em> -> 
    Choose newly created folder <tt>build_debug</tt></li>
  <li>In <em>Behaviour</em>: In <em>Build (incremential build)</em> remove 
    \em all
  </li>
  <li>Disable automatically build:
    In Heading bar: \em Project -> remove <em>Build automatically</em>
  </li>
</ol>

You find the binary in <tt>ug4/bin/</tt> with the name <tt>ugshell</tt>


<hr>
\section secInstallEclipseRunExecutable	Run ug-executable via Eclipse

If you want you can also start the executable from \em Eclipse.
This is especially useful if you like to use the build-in Debugger. 

<ol>
  <li><tt>ug4</tt> -> \em Properties </li>
  <li><em>Run/Debug Settings</em></li>
  <li>Click <em>New ...</em> -> <em>C/C++ Application</em></li>
  <li>Fill in executable: \em Browse -> <tt>ug4/bin/ugshell</tt></li>
  <li>Choose \em Arguments -> <em>Program arguments</em>:
    Fill in: <tt>-ex laplace.lua</tt>
  </li>
</ol>

Of course, if needed, use adapted arguments.


<hr>
\section secInstallEclipsePathSymbols Path and Symbols

\em Eclipse has a powerful Autocompletion-Mechanism, Syntax-Highlighting for 
C++ and many other things.
To make them available, you have to tell Eclipse, where to look for:

<ol>
  <li>Click right on folder \c ug4 -> Choose \em Properties </li>
  <li>Under <em>C/C++-General</em> -> Subfolder <em>Path and Symbols</em></li>
  <li>Under \em Includes click <em>Add ...</em></li>
  <li>Click on <em>Workspace ...</em> and choose the folder \c ugbase </li>
  <li>Check: <em>Add to all languages</em> and <em>Add to all 
    configurations</em>
  </li>
</ol> 

If you use build flags, you must tell \em Eclipse to recognize them.
Specially, if you do not use \c UG_PARALLEL, all Parallel Code will not be 
highlighted but regarded as dead code.
So, add it to the Environment:

<ol>
  <li>Click right on folder \c ug4 -> Choose \em Properties </li>
  <li>Under <em>C/C++-General</em> -> Subfolder <em>Path and Symbols</em></li>
  <li>Under \em Symbols click <em>Add ...</em></li>
  <li>Fill in \c UG_PARALLEL, value: \c ON </li>
  <li>Check: <em>Add to all languages</em> and <em>Add to all 
    configurations</em>
  </li>
</ol> 


<hr>
\section secInstallEclipseSyntaxLua Syntax Highlighting in Lua 

\em Lua is the recommended scripting language in \ug4.
In order to have a more comfortable editing of Lua-Scripts you should install a 
Plugin.
We created an own plugin which provides Syntax Highlighting and code completion for
the ug4 registry functions/classes: Go here <a href="http://gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de/Members/mrupp/ug4-auto-completion/">ugIDE</a> for further details.
<br><br>
Available Plugins:
\note You can only install one plugin at a time.

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de/Members/mrupp/ug4-auto-completion/">ugIDE</a></li>
<li> luaEclipse:<br>
You find a link to the install site under:
http://luaeclipse.luaforge.net/preview/update-site<br>
E.g. on MacOSX use:
http://luaeclipse.luaforge.net/preview/update-site/macosx.carbon/site.xml
<ol>
  <li>Open plugin install panel: \em Help -> <em>Install new Software ...</em></li>
  <li>Insert link above into: <em>Work with: ....</em></li>
  <li>Choose <em>LuaEclipse 1.3.1</em> and click <em>next</em></li>
  <li>Accept license agreement</li>
  <li>Finish and restart</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(not recommended) \em LunarEclipse 
(http://lunareclipse.sourceforge.net/update.html)
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
\section secInstallEclipseSyntaxDoxygen Syntax Highlighting for Doxygen

As \em Doxygen is used for generating the documentation for \ug4, it is handy 
having the \em Doxygen commands as <tt>\\brief</tt>, <tt>\\param</tt> or alike 
highlighted correctly.

In \em Eclipse one have to activate that implicitly.
Therefore two actions need to be taken in \em Eclipse:
<ol>
  <li><em>Window</em> (<em>Eclipse</em>) or-> <em>Preferences</em> -> <em>C / C++</em> -> 
    <em>File Types</em> -> <em>New ...</em> -> <tt>*.doxygen</tt> and
    <em>Type</em> -> <em>C++ Source</em>.
    Confirm with <em>OK</em>.
  </li>
  <li><em>Window</em> (<em>Eclipse</em>) or-> <em>Preferences</em> -> <em>C / C++</em> -> 
    <em>Editor</em>, under <em>Documentation tool comments</em> select <em>Doxygen</em> as workspace default.
    Confirm with <em>OK</em>.
    </li>
</ol>

\section secInstallEclipseAdditional Additional Tipps & Tricks

 - Speeding up the indexer: Eclipse -> Properties. Subfolder C/C++ -> Indexer : Disable Index unused headers, Enable Index source and header files opened in editor.
 - Line Numbers: Eclipse -> Properties. Subfolder General -> Editors -> Text Editors. Enable "Show line numbers".
 - Show Changes in File: Eclipse -> Properties. Subfolder General -> Editors -> Text Editors -> <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftasks-cvs-quickdiff.htm">Quick Diff</a>. Enable "Show differences in overview ruler" and set "SVN Working Copy Base" as reference source.
 - Switching Tabs: On Mac: Cmd+F6. On Windows: Ctrl+F6. Ctrl+PageUp / Ctrl+PageDown: Cycle through tabs without showing a list.
 - search a file in the tabs: Cmd+E (Mac)
 - search a symbol (e.g. function) in the current file: Cmd+O (Mac) or Ctrl+O (other)
 - quick open a resource (e.g. a file): Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (other). Enter filename.
 - quick open a symbol: Cmd+Shift+T (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+T (other). Enter type/class/function name (will only work when current file is .h or .cpp)
 - correct indention: Cmd+i (Mac) or Ctrl+i (other)
 - goto line: Cmd+L (Mac) or Ctrl+L (other)
 - You can change key mappings under Eclipse -> Properties, General -> Keys. (e.g. Next Editor to Ctrl+Tab, previous Editor to Ctrl+Shift+Tab)
 - Other recommended plugins are <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/cmake-editor">CMake plugin</a> (install site http://cmakeed.sourceforge.net/eclipse/), 
  <a href="http://texlipse.sourceforge.net/screenshots/">TeXclipse</a> (install site http://texlipse.sourceforge.net).

<hr>
\section secUG4ProjectInEclipse Create an UG4 project from exisiting source in Eclipse
Sometimes you already have checked out the source and just want to add ug4 as a project into Eclipse.
This can be the case if you did svn manually or want to use Eclipse to remotely edit files that
you access via \ref secSSHFS or via other file networks.

<ul>
  <li>In Eclipse's Menu, choose \em File -> \em New -> <em> C++ Project</em>
  </li>
  <li>Uncheck "Use default location"  </li>
  <li>Use "Browse" to select the root directory of your ug4.</li>
  <li>Enter a name for that project. This can be different from the name of your ug4 directory and
  has to be different from all other projects in eclipse, so you could also choose something like "ug4onHermit". </li>
</ul>

Note that this will create two new files in your ug4 directory: .cproject and .project.
If you want to use this project in another eclipse (like another version or on another computer),
you have to use \em File -> \em Import -> <em> Existing Projects into Workspace </em>.

\section secInstallEclipseTroubleshooting Troubleshooting

- Eclipse hangs up at "Loading workbench": Try to reset your workspace (see below)
- C++-Autocompletion not working/hanging up: Try to reset your workspace (see below)
- Reset your workspace: Quit Eclipse. Go to your workspace directory, and there to <tt>.metadata/.plugins</tt>. (That's where eclipse stores all the workspace data, like which projects you have in eclipse, and also
C++-Indexer files).  Delete all directories there except for <tt>org.eclipse.core.resources</tt>, <tt>org.eclipse.core.runtime</tt> and <tt>org.eclipse.cdt.core</tt>.
Index files are stored in <tt>org.eclipse.cdt.core</tt>, you can delete that too if it is still not working. There's also a script for that in
<tt>ug4/scripts/shell/ugrestoreworkspace</tt> (execute in your workspace dir). 
- SVN Information not showing for a project: Try to delete the project from the workspace, then add it again (import -> existing workspace).
- A project is damaged in eclipse and you want to set it up from scratch: Delete it from the workspace. Quit Eclipse. Go to the projects directory and delete the files <tt>.project</tt>, <tt>.cproject</tt> and <tt>.settings</tt>.
